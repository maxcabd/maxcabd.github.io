The internet runs on links.

Links to videos. Links to files. Links to ideas. Links to value.

But one thing links have never been able to do well is get paid.

If you want to sell something digital today, you are forced into platforms that were not built for how people actually share content. You need storefronts, product pages, onboarding flows, and dashboards. You need to bring people somewhere else.

That breaks the natural flow of the internet.

People do not share storefronts. They share links.

So we built Blinked.

# What is Blinked

Blinked lets you sell digital content with a link.

Upload a file. Set a price. Share the link.

That is it.

No storefront. No setup. No friction.

The link becomes the product.

When someone opens it, they can instantly pay and access the content. Delivery is automatic. No manual fulfillment. No waiting.

It works anywhere links work. Messages. Social media. Email. Anywhere.

# Built for how people actually share

Creators today operate in conversations, not storefronts.

They sell in DMs. In group chats. On Instagram. On Threads. On Discord.

The infrastructure never adapted to that.

Blinked does not try to pull people into a platform. It works inside the flow that already exists.

Create once. Share anywhere.

# Digital value should move instantly

Digital content is instant by nature.

Payments and delivery should be too.

With Blinked, the moment someone pays, access is granted immediately. No delays. No manual steps. No complexity.

The entire transaction happens through a single link.

# Simple by design

We built Blinked around a simple idea.

Selling digital content should feel like sending a message.

Not running a store.

Not managing a platform.

Just creating something valuable and sharing it.
