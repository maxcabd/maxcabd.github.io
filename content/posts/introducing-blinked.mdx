The internet runs on links.

Every day, billions of links are shared across messages, social media, and communities. Links are how information moves. Links are how people discover value.

But links have never been able to capture value directly.

If you want to sell something digital today, you are forced into systems that interrupt how the internet actually works. You gotta create storefronts, manage product pages, and bring people into platforms they were never trying to visit.

People do not want to send storefronts. They want to send links.

# Sell with a link

Blinked makes digital content sellable through a single link.

Upload your content. Set a price. Share the link.

When someone opens it, they can instantly unlock the content through a frictionless payment flow.

No manual delivery. No waiting. No signing up.

The link becomes the product.

# Built for how people share today

Creators do not operate through storefronts. They operate through conversations.

They share their work on Instagram, X (Twitter), Threads, Discord, and messaging apps. They sell directly to their audience, wherever their audience already is.

Create once. Share anywhere.

</div>

# Instant access, instant delivery

With Blinked, access is granted immediately after payment. The entire transaction happens through the link itself.

This removes friction for both creators and buyers.

Creators do not need to manage fulfillment.

Buyers don't need to sign up. Just tap to pay.

</div>

# Simple by design

Selling digital content should feel as natural as sharing it.

Just create something valuable, share the link, and get paid.
