# What is debin?

Debin was born of a need to parse binary data intuitively without all the boilerplate and complexity that traditional methods provide in Python.
Writing binary parsers should be simple and straightforward, and debin aims to provide that simplicity by leveraging Python's dataclasses. By using dataclasses,
we can skip all the boilerplate that comes with defining Python classes and instead focus on the structure of the binary data we want to parse and not how to parse it.
With debin, we can have a consistency in our binary parsing code that is hard to achieve with other methods and libraries.

I had much difficulty in finding binary parser in Python that:

1. Was declarative in nature
2. Was easy to use without all the boilerplate
3. Included C like types like
4. Encouraged type safety in the context of Python



Finding a library that did all of these things was difficult, so I decided to write my own.
